# COMHRAC

Comhrac (Gaelic for "Combat") is a comprehensive training, nutrition, and social platform for martial artists and combat sport athletes. 

## Development

### Initial Setup
These applications are required for development.

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
- [Expo](https://expo.dev)

### Getting Started

1. **Clone project:** `git clone https://github.com/jhegarty14/comhrac.git`
2. **`secrets.properties`:** Create a file called `secrets.properties` in `api/env`. You will need to request secrets from a member of the Comhrac development team.
3. **Build Images:** Go into the comhrac directory and run `docker-compose build`
4. **Start Containers:** `docker-compose up`
5. **Local Site Access:** The Expo client runs inside the `ui` docker container. Scan the QR code in the `docker-compose up` output in your terminal to see code changes reflected in the UI on your phone.
6. **API Access:** Type `localhost:19000` into your browser or Postman, followed by the api endpoint (ex: `localhost:19000/api/v1/users/`)

### REST Response

We are using a custom renderer ([Respond](https://github.com/matryer/respond)) to have our JSON responses in a predefined structure.

```
{
    "data": { }, // Either an object or an array, "data" contains the data returned directly from the handler. Only shown if the "errors" key is empty.
    "errors": [ // "errors is an array of error objects, either those generated by the system, or supplied by the handler.
        {
            "title": "", // Title of the error. Optional string.
            "detail: [ ], // Detailed description of the error. Required array of strings.
        },
    ],
    "meta": { } // "meta" is an object for system use that does not have a defined structure and can be used for just about anything the system needs.

}
```
